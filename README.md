# Scent-Depth
:拥抱型笑脸:Hello!  This is a PyTorch project for single-view depth estimation using knowledge distillation! :拥抱型笑脸:

## :眼睛:Project Introduction
This project implements a method for single-view depth estimation that combines knowledge distillation and supervised learning. The method uses an ensemble of student networks and a teacher network for knowledge distillation. Our paper introducing this method is:

## :电脑: Installation
To install this project, you will need:
- PyTorch 1.7.1
- PyTorch Lightning 1.1.6
You can install the requirements using:
pip install -r requirements.txt
## :火箭: Getting Started 
To train the model on your own dataset, you can: 
1. Create PyTorch DataLoaders for your training, validation and test sets
2. Define hyperparameters in hparams.py 
3. Run python train.py to start training! 
The trained models and logs will be saved to lightning_logs/ by default.
